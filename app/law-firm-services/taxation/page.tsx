          Why Taxation Law Matters
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">
          Tax laws in Nigeria are constantly evolving, and non-compliance can
          lead to significant penalties. Businesses must navigate corporate
          taxes, VAT, and personal tax obligations while maximizing deductions
          and exemptions.
